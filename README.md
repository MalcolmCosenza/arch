Dotfiles and notes to remember

I will keep here the changes I make to the three system it's currently running on.
The main device I'm using at the moment is a HP Elitebook 2540p (quad) as uni laptop, a Macbook Pro 6,2(intel quad + GeForce 340) and a Lenovo Workstation(octa+Firepro 5700).

My workflow across devices is similar enough to not warrant a separate repository for each device, even though the macbook is a completely different beast and I am currently having issues with an upstream bug with the nvdia drivers.

I don't game at all on my linux devices and always keep double/triple boot on each.

Occasionally I wil share my thoughs on something or some notes on why I went for a solution instead of another.
